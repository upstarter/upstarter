### Hi there, I'm Eric Steen 👋

#### 👯  &nbsp; I’m looking for collaborators on an AI project <a href="https://www.github.com/upstarter/automata" target="_blank">Automata</a>. Lately I've been doing Devops and helping build out greenfield distributed systems as a consultant at <a href="https://www.taos.com" target="_blank">Taos</a>.

#### What I've been doing

4 years working with service mesh technology, mostly on a data plane using Envoy as an edge proxy to handle service-to-service communication between microservices on gcp docker-optimized containers:

	1. API Gateway – An envoy data plane API Gateway ingress.
	2. AI service – A python deep learning node for batch analytics.
	3. Frontend – A react/redux, webpack, JSS grid, ES7 frontend with
	   Enterprise Integration Patterned middleware.
	4. Backend – A DDD designed event-driven Elixir Umbrella w/ OTP  that runs
 	   state machines on RDBMS, firestore, and graph data stores, ETS in-memory database,
	   Phoenix Registry PubSub, and front-end support.
  
The mesh relies on comprehensive end-to-end security (SSL/TLS, http-only secure cookie JWT access/refresh sessions, multi-layer credentials), cloudflare CDN, Envoy  for load balancing, http filtering, automatic retries, global rate limiting, circuit breaking. NGINX w/ CORS, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with abstract reusable Terraform libraries. Mesh used for analytics platform, machine learning pipelines for the crypto space. Processes include Trunk Based Development, GitOps, CI/CD, extensive CLI efficiency-enabling bash scripts. Includes boostrappers Blue/Green & Canary deploys, Terraform Vault, and Chaos Injection. Extreme programming with merciless refactoring, automated testing, clean code, SOLID, eye towards performance and security.
