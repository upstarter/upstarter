### Hi there, I'm Eric Steen ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on WealthTech and AI projects, work in AI, data engineering and science, Devops and/or lead the development of new projects.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning *Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Concurrent & Distributed AI Systems*, *Multi-Armed Contextual Bandits w/ Strategic Arms*, *Taskable Reinforcement Learning w/ Finite Automata Reward Machines*, *Linear Temporal Logic*

- ðŸ¤” I'm currently looking for help with these projects:
  - [Cryptowise](https://www.github.com/upstarter/cryptowise) - An ecosystem for quantamental traders and investors
  - [The Automata Project](https://www.github.com/upstarter/automata) - An framework for building mult-agent artificially intelligent autonomous decentralized systems.

<!--- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a flask extension for [Adaptive Products](https://www.ericsteen.dev) -->
